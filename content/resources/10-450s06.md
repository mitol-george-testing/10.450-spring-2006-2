description: A large tank must be filled with liquid from a supply line. One operator
  stands at ground level to operate the feed valve. Another stands on the tank, gauging
  its level with a dipstick. When the tank is near full, the stick operator will instruct
  the other to start closing the valve. Overfilling can cause spills, but underfilling
  will cause later process problems. (Lesson 1 image by Dr. Barry Johnston.)
